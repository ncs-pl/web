/* Fluid layouts is an intuitive and responsive layout solution in which you
   place the children of an element on a row, in a specific order, and then
   decide the direction of the row (vertical or horizontal axis) and alignment
   (left, center, right/top, middle, bottom) of the children.

   To get started, you simply need to add a fl-DA class to an element in your
   document, where D is the value for the direction of the fluid layout, and A
   is the value for the alignment of the children in a fluid layout.

   Directions:

   * (v)ertical: children are placed on a vertical row, and may wrap on a new
     one if there are not enough space available.

   * (h)orizontal: children are placed on a horizontal row, and may wrap on a
     new one if there are not enough space available.

   Alignments:

   * (t) top: aligns children from the top of the vertical row,
     only with vertical directions.

   * (m) middle: aligns children from the middle of the vertical row,
     only with vertical directions.

   * (b) bottom: aligns children from the bottom of the vertical row,
     only with vertical directions.

   * (l) left: aligns children from the left of the horizontal row,
     only with horizontal directions.

   * (c) center: aligns children from the center of the horizontal row,
     only with horizontal directions.

   * (r) right: aligns children from the right of the horizontal row,
     only with horizontal directions.

   * (a) auto: evenly space the gap between children on the row.

   Fluid layouts should work on all modern browsers, starting with IE11.
   Avoid using min-height with fluid layouts on IE11, as the browser won't
   align items correctly due to some bugs in their implementation. */
